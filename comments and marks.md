### 80/100. Very nice work. Please find the comments below for details.
### Scores on each part
#### 1. Introduction and data description 
##### 4/5 The introduction is nice, but would be better to move the code cells at the beginning to the end of the introduction setion. For the data description, would be better to add more details before section 1.2.
#### 2. Formulation of research question
##### 4/5 Clear formulation of the research questions.
#### 3. Data acquisition
##### 9/10 Well-organized code for web scraping.
#### 4. Data cleaning and reshaping
##### 26.5/30 Good to group code into different parts with some explanations, demonstrating strong abilities in data cleaning. 
#### 5. Visualization
##### 23/30 Various plots including an interactive map (not shown on the notebook, but that is fine), line plot, histogram, distribution plots with explanations. But I free some of the plots could be further improved. For instance, would be better to make the lines in the distriutional plots wider. 
#### 6. Data modelling
##### 5/10 I did not see much related to this part. I understand you did some characteristics analysis and speed analysis in the notebook. But take the speed analysis as an example. It would be interesting to study for instance the relationship between the speed and some other explanatory variables, such as the geo location, time of the day, etc. Then you can apply regression or classification analysis to the data. 
#### 7. Conclusion and the overall structure 
##### 7.5/10 The structure is good. For the conclusion, might be better to provide some suggestions based on your analysis or discuss some related work or problems.
